[fluid-description]
hydrocarbon-slush=A mixture of ice and hydrocarbons which comprises the subterranean oceans of [planet=nauvis].
short-chain-hydrocarbons=Lightweight hydrocarbons which are suitable as a fuel source.
organic-sludge=A mixture of organic compounds and micro-organisms. The residue of a dying ecosystem.
mineral-lubricant=A mineral based lubricant capable of remaining suitably slippery at high temperatures. It's relatively chemically inert. An ideal general purpose lubricant.
ferric-solution=A solution of iron in hydrocarbons (despite iron not actually being soluble in hydrocarbons. This is a video game.)
