[fluid-description]
hydrocarbon-slush=A mixture of ice and hydrocarbons which comprise the subterranian oceans of Arrival
short-chain-hydrocarbons=Lightweight hydrocarbons which are suitable as a fuel source
organic-sludge=A mixture of organic compounds and micro-organisms, the residue of a dying ecosystem.
mineral-lubricant=A mineral based lubricant capable of remaining suitably slippery at high temperatures. It's relatively chemically inert. An ideal general purpose lubricant.
ferric-solution=A solution of iron in hydrocarbons, dispite iron not actually being soluable in hydrocarbons, this is a video game.
