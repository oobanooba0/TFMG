[fluid-description]
hydrocarbon-slush=A mixture of ice and hydrocarbons which comprises the subterranean oceans of [planet=nauvis].
short-chain-hydrocarbons=Lightweight hydrocarbons. Combustable in the presence of oxygen and a precursor to more complex molocules.
organic-sludge=A mixture of organic compounds and micro-organisms. The residue of a dying ecosystem.
mineral-lubricant=A mineral based lubricant capable of remaining suitably slippery at high temperatures. It's relatively chemically inert. An ideal general purpose lubricant for when you don't want your combustion spontaneous.
ferric-solution=A solution of iron in hydrocarbons (despite iron not actually being soluble in hydrocarbons. This is a video game. It's gonna be okay.)
steam=Vaporised water at high temperature. Can spin turbines, sterilise, or be used in chemistry.
water=Condensed steam at low temperature. Acts as a powerful solvent and coolant.
thruster-fuel=A liquid fuel made of refined hydrocarbons, Burns rapidly highly explosive when combined with oxygen. Ideal as a rocket fuel.
thruster-oxidizer=Pure liquid oxygen, extremely dangerous. Must be kept cool and pressurised.
nothing=Shouldn't be crafted dispite the recipe, this fluid blocks the regular pipe outputs allowing unpipable fluids to kinda work. (for autofluidbox indexing reasons) Hopefully better fluid indexing can be added to factorio that would remove the need for the akwardness of this fluid.\n\nThe fuel value is actually used for the purposes of the power monitor, which as a compound entity is comprised of 7 parts. 3 of which are generators fueled by "Nothing" and are used to calculate the grid power load.
industrial-acid=A powerful acid useful for dissolving metals and general chemistry. Due to it's highly corrosive nature, it cannot be safely transported through pipes.\n\nUnpipable
