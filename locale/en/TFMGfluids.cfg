[fluid-description]
hydrocarbon-slush=A mixture of ice and hydrocarbons which comprises the subterranean oceans of [planet=nauvis].
short-chain-hydrocarbons=Lightweight hydrocarbons. Combustable in the presence of oxygen and a precursor to more complex molocules.
organic-sludge=A mixture of organic compounds and micro-organisms. The residue of a dying ecosystem.
mineral-lubricant=A mineral based lubricant capable of remaining suitably slippery at high temperatures. It's relatively chemically inert. An ideal general purpose lubricant for when you don't want your combustion spontaneous.
ferric-solution=A solution of iron in hydrocarbons (despite iron not actually being soluble in hydrocarbons. This is a video game. It's gonna be okay.)
steam=Vaporised water at high temperature. Can spin turbines, sterilise, or be used in chemistry.
water=Condensed steam at low temperature. Acts as a powerful solvent and coolant.
thruster-fuel=A liquid fuel made of refined hydrocarbons, Burns rapidly highly explosive when combined with oxygen. Ideal as a rocket fuel.\n\nCannot be piped.
thruster-oxidizer=Pure liquid oxygen, extremely dangerous. Must be kept cool and pressurised.\n\nCannot be piped.
