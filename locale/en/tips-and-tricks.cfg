thermal-system-basics=TFMG includes a thermal system. In space, most buildings will produce heat in proportion to the energy they consume.\n\nEach machine has a waste heat ratio, which is the ratio of energy consumed to the heat energy produced. A higher waste heat ratio means more heat will be produced.\n\nHeat produced is affected by modules and beacons.\n\nBuildings that get too hot will overheat, and stop working. To prevent this, you must use [item=small-radiator] to remove heat.\n\nEvery building has a unique layout of heat pipe connections. Some more complex than others, make sure to consider these when designing builds.
thermal-system-damage=Every machine has two thresholds; its maximum working temperature, beyond which it will stop operating. And its maximum safe temperature, beyond which the machine will start taking damage. Most machines will stop working before they take damage, so they will never damage themselves.\n\nHowever, some machines, like furnaces, have working temperatures higher than other machines safe temperatures. When these machines are connected by heatpipes, one machine can overheat another, causing it to take damage, and eventually be destroyed.\n\nPay attention to a machines working and safe temperatures, and make sure to provide adequate cooling capacity to prevent damage.
