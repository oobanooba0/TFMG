thermal-system-basics=TFMG includes a thermal system. In space, most buildings will produce heat in proportion to the energy they consume.\n\nEach machine has a waste heat ratio, which is the ratio of energy consumed to the heat energy produced. A higher waste heat ratio means more heat will be produced.\n\nHeat produced is affected by modules and beacons.\n\nBuildings that get too hot will overheat, and stop working. To prevent this, you must use [item=small-radiator] to remove heat.\n\nEvery building has a unique layout of heat pipe connections. Some more complex than others, make sure to consider these when designing builds.
thermal-system-damage=Every machine has two thresholds; its maximum working temperature, beyond which it will stop operating. And its maximum safe temperature, beyond which the machine will start taking damage. Most machines will stop working before they take damage, so they will never damage themselves.\n\nHowever, some machines, like furnaces, have working temperatures higher than other machines safe temperatures. When these machines are connected by heatpipes, one machine can overheat another, causing it to take damage, and eventually be destroyed.\n\nPay attention to a machines working and safe temperatures, and make sure to provide adequate cooling capacity to prevent damage.
supercomputer-basics=Supercomputers are the final step in crafting science, they convert unverified tech cards, into verfied tech cards by solving circuit problems. This may seem complicated, because it is.\n\nBefore you start, make sure your supercomputer has a recipe set, and an appropriate unverified tech card inside. Only once the supercomputer is ready to craft will it offer its "recipe" and begin drawing power\n\nThe supercomputers output terminal (blue) will contain all the signals you need to solve its problem, while the Supercomputer input terminal (green) is how you will interact with the supercomputer, and is where you should send the solution. Red/Green wires do not matter, the terminal will accept signals on both, and evaluate them individually.\n\nWhen you provide the correct solution, the supercomputer will craft for one tick.\n\nEach verification recipe is unique, read the recipe description for specific information on how to solve them.
supercomputer-introspection=Introspection Science is the first and most basic verification recipe. Your goal is to build a 4 function calculator that can Add, Subtract, Multiply or Divide [virtual-signal=signal-A] and [virtual-signal=signal-B]. Depending on what operator signal [virtual-signal=signal-plus],[virtual-signal=signal-minus],[virtual-signal=signal-multiplication],[virtual-signal=signal-division] the supercomputer output terminal provides.\n\nAfter calculating the solution, it should be sent to the supercomputer input terminal in the form of [virtual-signal=signal-X].
supercomputer-par-time=Every supercomputer recipe has a "par time". This is the amount of time (in ticks) that a reasonably efficient solution should take to solve the problem.\n\nIf your solution is taking significantly longer than this par time, consider looking at the problem from a different angle, taking a break from it, or researching the problem on the internet.\n\nSolving problems faster also yeilds bonus science at the ratio of bonus = your time/par time. (capped at 500%). Designing faster computers is highly encouraged.\n\nTime taken starts counting from the tick the recipe is generated.
