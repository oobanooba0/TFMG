[item-description]
#intermediates
#chunks
ferric-asteroid-chunk=This asteroid is primarily comprised of metallic iron, but also contains various rare metals in significant quantites. More advanced processing methods could allow you to isolate these metals.
crystalline-asteroid-chunk=Crystalline asteroids are comprised of a variety of minerals which have arranged themselves into lattice structures unique to zero-gravity enviroments. Has facinating electrical properties.
#plates
ferric-plate=A sheet of ferrous metal. May or may not actually contain iron.
hot-mineral-plate=A sheet of minerals, still malleable and barely cool enough to handle, crystals are slowly forming as it cools, This may or may not be desirable.
crystalline-plate=A sheet of minerals, displaying crystal structures unique to zero gravity. It glimmers with potential.
mineral-glass=A sheet of minerals with an amorphous internal structure. Non conductive under normal circumstances.

#structural
general-purpose-structure=General purpose structure is a cheap and easy to produce structural material for use in situations where luxuries like "low weight", "high strength" or "corrosion resistance" aren't required. General purpose structure can be manufactured from any material deemed "good enough."

#mechanical
mechanical-components=Mechanical mechanisms motivate movement of mechanical machinery. The foundation for any machine that moves.

#electronic
conductive-coil=Conducts electricity and generates magnetic feilds.
modular-circuit=Circuit boards are the start of any good engineering project, from high school students to superinteligent ai.

#science
introspection-science-unverified=Take this data card to a supercomputer[item=supercomputer] and analyse it to get a verified data card.
exploration-science-unverified=Take this data card to a supercomputer[item=supercomputer] and analyse it to get a verified data card.
#science verified
introspection-science=information about yourSELF is neatly organised and ready for your consideration.
exploration-science=Hundreds of gigabytes of data about the local enviroment is stored within the memory chips on this card. Ready for your observation.

#advanced
ai-processor=Capable of performing the calculations which AI software requires.
spidertron-frame=The housing of a spidertron unit.
manipulation-tool=The manipulation tool is a device which allows for the placement, assembly, and dissasembly of buildings. All this functionality is provided by a single tool which looks suspiciously like an allen key.

#spiders
scout-o-tron=Small and quick, while sturdy enough to survive re-entry the scout'o'tron is capable of exploration and small scale construction tasks. It lacks any sort of weapon by default, but it has a small utility grid which can enhance the scout'o'trons capabilities.
scout-o-tron-pod=This scout'o'tron is packed up and ready to be deployed to a planet, It's pre-equipped with the minimum required utility to get started.
