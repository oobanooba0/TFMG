#chunks
ferric-asteroid-chunk=This asteroid is primarily comprised of metallic iron, but also contains various rare metals in significant quantities. More advanced processing methods could allow you to isolate these metals.
crystalline-asteroid-chunk=Crystalline asteroids are comprised of a variety of minerals which have arranged themselves into lattice structures unique to zero-gravity environments. Has fascinating electrical properties.
volatile-asteroid-chunk=Dispite originating from [planet=nauvis], they don't appear in it's orbit, likely due to the gravitational influence of its parent body, [space-location=limit], which cause orbits around the moon to become unstable. Some ice geysir eruptions are so violent, that hydrocarbon slush is launched out of orbit and ends up in interplanetary space, and solidifies into volatile chunks, trapping hydrocarbons, water, and volatile gasses inside them. These chunks have accumulated over billions of years, and now are quite abundant. 
#ore
ferric-ore=Identical in composition to ferric chunks, but broken down into smaller pieces better suited for refining. 
titanium-ore=What remains of ferric ore when the iron is removed. It's mostly titanium, but still contains trace metals (though not enough to inhibit its function) and might actually alloy with the titanium for superior structural properties compared to the pure form.
mineral-ore=Finer crystals, exceptionally hard, but somewhat brittle. Suitable as an aggregate in concrete, or for further refining into mineral glass or oil.
pure-iron-ore=Pure iron, ready to be molten down and cast into ferric plates.
#intermediates
#plates
ferric-plate=A sheet of ferrous metal. May or may not actually contain iron.
hot-mineral-plate=A sheet of minerals, still malleable and barely cool enough to handle. Crystals are slowly forming as it cools; this may or may not be desirable.
crystalline-plate=A sheet of minerals, displaying crystal structures unique to zero gravity. It glimmers with potential.
mineral-glass=A sheet of minerals with an amorphous internal structure. Non-conductive under normal circumstances.
titanium-plate=A sheet of titanium, lightweight and strong. The superior material for structural purposes even under extreme conditions, at the cost of being difficult to work and much harder to refine.

#plastic chain stuff idk
microbe-culture=A culture of hydro-carbon consuming bacteria native to [planet=nauvis]. They naturally consume and metabolise water and hydrocarbons to form increasingly longer carbon chains. Outside of their natural habitat they enter a "panic" state and will rapidly spin themselves polymer cocoons to protect themselves. This often leads to their demise as they exhaust all available materials.
organic-carbon=The dessicated remains of organic life. Works as a solid form of carbon and a solid fuel.
active-bio-polymers=These microbes are slowly spinning more and more polymer, entangling and merging with neighbours as they work. Eventually, they will encase themselves in a single macro-scale cocoon. 
polymer-bar=A large bar of plastic polymers. flexible, lightweight and nonconductive and incredibly easy to work with. An ocean of possibilities await.
#structural
general-purpose-structure=General purpose structure is a cheap and easy to produce structural material for use in situations where luxuries like "low weight", "high strength" or "corrosion resistance" aren't required. General purpose structure can be manufactured from any material deemed "good enough."
high-performance-structure=Stronger, lighter, and more corrosion resistant than previous structural technologies. All good things begin with liberal application of material sciences.

#mechanical
mechanical-components=Mechanical mechanisms motivate movement of mechanical machinery. The foundation for any machine that moves.
mechatronic-components=Mechatronics are the foundation of anything that must move, and must also not move. Exactly when you need it to, and exactly when you need it not to. Every time, with precision and elegance. The only thing it lacks is the ability to decide by itself when to move.

#electronic
conductive-coil=Conducts electricity and generates magnetic fields. According to physics, that's actually the same thing. Kinda.
optical-coil=Conducts light. According to physics, that's also somehow the same thing as the other two things.
capacitor-charged=A capacitor which is currently charged, ready to discharge at a moment's notice. While useful, the ability to rapidly discharge also makes this potentially dangerous to handle, Can also be used to store energy.
capacitor-discharged=A capacitor, currently discharged, useful for electronics or for electrical storage. Can be used in equipment grids. Charging is not perfectly efficient, and some energy is always lost.
modular-circuit=Circuit boards are the start of any good engineering project, from high school students to superintelligent AI.
ai-processor=Creativity on a chip. Capable of performing the calculations which AI software requires.

introspection-science=Many kilobytes of information about yourSELF is neatly organised and recorded on this card.\n\nReady for your consideration.
exploration-science=Hundreds of megabytes of data about the local environment is stored within the memory chips on this card, terrain geometry, climate data, recorded LIFE forms, and resource distributions.\n\nReady for your contemplation.
exploitation-science=Gigabytes of research about known resources, material properties, methods for synthesis and mechanical simulations fills this card's memory.\n\nReady for your observation.

#advanced
mechanical-leg=A spidertron leg, capable of traversing rough environments much better than wheels. Additional legs can be placed in an equipment grid for faster locomotion.
spidertron-frame=The housing of a spidertron unit.
manipulation-tool=The manipulation tool is a device which allows for the placement, assembly, and disassembly of buildings. All this functionality is provided by a single tool which looks suspiciously like an allen key.
excited-crystalline-chunk-red=Energy burns within the crystal. It almost seems to scream, as if waiting for release.
excited-crystalline-chunk-blue=Energy floods the crystal. It almost seems to sigh, as if waiting for release.
fused-crystalline-chunk=Energy seamlessly flows between the two sides of the crystal tracing complex fractal patterns. It makes no sound at all, at peace.
#spiders
scout-o-tron=Small and quick, while sturdy enough to survive re-entry, the Scout'o'tron is capable of exploration and small scale construction tasks. It lacks any sort of weapon by default, but it has a small utility grid which can enhance the Scout'o'trons capabilities.
scout-o-tron-pod=This Scout'o'tron is packed up and ready to be deployed to a planet. It's pre-equipped with the minimum required utility to get started.
#military
toolbelt-equipment=Toolbelts expand the storage capacity of any vehicle they're placed in. Useful when a construction project requires a serious quantity of items. The factory must be expanded, after all.
stone-wall=Walls are tough and relatively cheap, capable of absorbing damage which would otherwise have destroyed more fragile, and valuable, parts of the factory. A neccesary sacrifice.
gate=Access control.
laser-turret=Laser turrets provide low damage, quickly, and cheaply. With the ability to rapidly swivel and engage different targets and decent range, theyre ideal for picking off small and mobile targets which other, heavier defences might miss.
#tile
space-platform-foundation=Heavy space platforms are cheap foundations suitable for stationary space platforms, but due to their mass, they're inefficient for moving platforms.
light-space-platform-foundation=Light space platforms are much more expensive than their counterpart, but are also much lighter, this makes them ideal situations where mass matters, like space platforms.
concrete=Concrete provides a much more stable building foundation than natural surfaces, but also is able to discourage burrowing creatures from emerging where it is placed.
#lol
barrel=Barrels are able to store a variety of fluids, allowing for the transport of fluids by belt or rocket, or in situations where pipes may not be appropriate.
pistol=A consolation prize for dying. If only you had hands...
