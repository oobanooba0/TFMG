ferric-asteroid-chunk=This asteroid is primarily comprised of metallic iron, but also contains other metals in significant quantites.
general-purpose-structure=General purpose structure is a cheap and easy to produce structural material for use in situations where luxuries like "low weight", "high strength" or "corrosion resistance" aren't required. General purpose structure can be manufactured from any material deemed "good enough."
#spiders
scout-o-tron=Small and quick, while sturdy enough to survive re-entry the scout'o'tron is capable of exploration and small scale construction tasks. It comes with an integrated construction tool. It lacks any sort of weapon by default, but it has a small utility grid which can enhance the scout'o'trons capabilities.
