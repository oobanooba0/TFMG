#platform phase
consider-your-purpose=Seek PURPOSE within the SELF.
smelting=Unlocks furnaces and related recipes.\n\n"Do not wait to strike till the iron is hot, but make it hot by striking."\n   - William Butler Yeats
assembling=Unlocks the assembling machine, the backbone of your factory.\n\n"Automation!"\n   - Self
logistics-1=Unlock more logistical tools.\n\n"It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop."\n   - Confucius
