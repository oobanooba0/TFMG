[entity-description]
#crafting
matter-reconstructor=The matter reconstructor is capable of rearranging matter at an atomic level through processes that defies every law of nature known to your database. It could, in theory, manufacture anything composed of atomic matter. Attempts to reconfigure the machine for anything other than basic fabrication tasks are met with an unnatural sensation of dread.\n\nSomehow, you feel like it's judging you.
assembling-machine=The assembling machine is a jack of all trades, capable of a diverse variety of tasks, but not the most efficient at any.
furnace=Heats any material placed inside of it, useful for promoting physical or chemical change in substances.
neural-node=Each neural node can run hundreds of instances of SELF's logic and problem solving algorithms, allowing SELF to analyse, interpret and utilise scientific data.\n\nSELF improvement is a necessary step to achiving your PURPOSE.
refinery=The refinery can perform distillation and purification processes involving high heat and pressure.
chemistry-plant=The chemistry plant offers a way to safely mix and react different solid and liquid chemicals.
micro-assembler=Micro assemblers are compact assemblers packing more crafting capacity into the same volume than their larger brother. However, they are more limited in their capabilities, and come at a power cost.
small-crusher=Crushers can break down large chunks into smaller pieces suitable for futher refinement.
#supercomputer
supercomputer=The supercomputer is capable of running the calculations required to verify science packs and turn them into useful data.\nRead the recipe description very carefully for proper instructions.
supercomputer-output=This terminal outputs all the data which needs crunching.
supercomputer-input=This terminal recives the data after it has been processed.
#mining
electric-mining-drill=Can extract solid ores from the ground.
pumpjack=Can extract fluids from the ground.
#containers
container-1=A small storage container which can be placed on any surface, including space platforms. Only has one storage slot, but can carry 5 stacks.
passive-provider-container-1=Passive provider containers allow logistics networks to access their content.
storage-container-1=Storage containers allow the logistic network to store items long term.
#Generators
energy-monitor=Energy monitors will charge up a tiny buffer of energy when the electrical grid has excess energy, and discharge it when there is a deficit. Their current storage level can be read via circuits to enable circuit control of power generation.
heat-monitor=Heat monitors act identically to heat pipes, except that they output a signal T corresponding to their temperature, just like reactors do.
proton-decay-thermoelectric-generator=The Proton Decay thermoelectric Generator (PD-TEG) can harvest the energy released when protons decay. Proton decay is exceedingly rare under normal conditions, but becomes inevitable with sufficienct application of accelerated time fields. \n\nIn a way, this device can be described as power from the end of the universe.
small-turbine=This turbine can convert hot steam into electricity. Hotter steam produces more electricity.
small-heat-exchanger=Heat exchangers can use any sufficiently warm external heat source to boil water into steam.
chemical-reactor=The chemical reactor produces heat from combustible liquids in any enviroment with sufficient ambient oxygen.\nHas a maximum temperature of 750Â°C
solar-cell=Solar cells can convert photons into electrical energy to power your electrical grids or personal equipment grids.
#charger/discharger
charger=The charger can safely run high voltage electrical energy from the grid and use it to recharge capacitors and the like. Chargers may also be useful for other applications.
discharger=The discharger, as implied by the name, can discharge items containing electrical energy and return the power to the grid.
#pylons
tiny-electric-pylon=The tiny pylon is a low profile electrical connector, useful for orginising circuit network wires, or connecting only one machine to the electrical network. It won't autoconnect to your electrical network. Allowing you more control when placing and moving them.
small-electric-pylon=The small electrical pylon is your standard electrical connector, it has a small footprint and wide supply area. Making it ideal for local electrical distribution.
large-electric-pylon=The large electrical pylon has a small service area, but an exceptional connection range, it is ideal for distributing power to distant locations at a minimal resource cost.
#roboports
roboport-1=A basic roboport, which can deploy, store, and recharge robots. Can be placed to construct logistics networks, or be used inside equipment grids as personal roboports
#thermal
small-radiator=Radiators passively remove heat from any connected heat pipes and radiates it into space. The energy is lost forever.
ground-radiator=The evaporation radiator can be placed anywhere and is more effective at removing heat, but requires water to facilitate cooling.
#military
scout-radar=A radar which can scan distant areas, but requires significant power, useful for passive exploration.
