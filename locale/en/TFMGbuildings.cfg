[entity-description]
#crafting
matter-reconstructor=The matter reconstructor is capable of rearranging matter at an atomic level through processes that defies every law of nature known to your database. It could, in theory, manufacture anything composed of atomic matter. Attempts to reconfigure the machine for anything other than basic fabrication tasks are met with an unnatural sensation of dread.\n\nSomehow, you feel like it's judging you.
assembling-machine=The assembling machine is a jack of all trades, capable of a diverse variety of tasks, but not the most efficient at any.
#thermal
small-radiator=Radiators passively remove heat from any connected heat pipes and radiate it into space. The energy is lost forever.
