[entity-description]
#crafting
matter-reconstructor=The matter reconstructor is capable of rearranging matter at an atomic level through processes that defies every law of nature known to your database. It could, in theory, manufacture anything composed of atomic matter. Attempts to reconfigure the machine for anything other than basic fabrication tasks are met with an unnatural sensation of dread.\n\nSomehow, you feel like it's judging you.
assembling-machine=The assembling machine is a jack of all trades, capable of a diverse variety of tasks, but not the most efficient at any.
assembling-machine-heat-interface=This machine will produce heat proportional to its energy consumption, if the machine gets too hot, it will stop working. Use heat pipes and radiators to remove waste heat.
furnace=Heats any material placed inside of it, useful for promoting physical or chemical change.
furnace-heat-interface=This machine will produce heat proportional to its energy consumption, if the machine gets too hot, it will stop working. Use heat pipes and radiators to remove waste heat.
neural-node=Each neural node can run hundreds of instances of SELF's logic and problem solving algorithms, allowing SELF to analyse, interpret and utilise scientific data.\n\nSELF improvement is a necessary step to achiving your PURPOSE.
refinery=The refinery can perform distillation and purification processes involving high heat and pressure.
chemistry-plant=The chemistry plant offers a way to safely mix and react different solid and liquid chemicals.
micro-assembler=Micro assemblers are compact assemblers packing more crafting capacity into the same volume than their larger brother. However, they are more limited in their capabilities, and come at a power cost.
small-crusher=Crushers can break down large chunks into smaller pieces suitable for futher refinement.
#supercomputer
supercomputer=The supercomputer is capable of running the calculations required to verify science packs and turn them into useful data.\nRead the recipe description very carefully for proper instructions.
supercomputer-output=This terminal outputs all the data which needs crunching.
supercomputer-input=This terminal recives the data after it has been processed.

#Generators
proton-decay-thermoelectric-generator=The Proton Decay thermoelectric Generator (PD-TEG) can harvest the energy released when protons decay. Proton decay is exceedingly rare under normal conditions, but becomes inevitable with sufficienct application of accelerated time fields. \n\nIn a way, this device can be described as power from the end of the universe.
small-turbine=This turbine can convert hot steam into electricity.
small-heat-exchanger=Heat exchangers can use any sufficiently hot external heat source to boil water into steam.
chemical-reactor=The chemical reactor produces heat from combustible liquids in any enviroment with sufficient ambient oxygen.
#pylons
tiny-electric-pylon=The tiny pylon is a low profile electrical connector, useful for orginising circuit network wires, or connecting only one machine to the electrical network. It won't autoconnect to your electrical network. Allowing you more control when placing and moving them.
small-electric-pylon=The small electrical pylon is your standard electrical connector, it has a small footprint and wide supply area. Making it ideal for local electrical distribution.
large-electric-pylon=The large electrical pylon has a small service area, but an exceptional connection range, it is ideal for distributing power to distant locations at a minimal resource cost.
#roboports
roboport-1=A basic roboport, which can deploy, store, and recharge robots.
#thermal
small-radiator=Radiators passively remove heat from any connected heat pipes and radiates it into space. The energy is lost forever.
#military
scout-radar=A radar which can scan distant areas, but requires significant power, useful for passive exploration.
