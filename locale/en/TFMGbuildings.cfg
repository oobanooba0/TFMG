[entity-description]
#crafting
matter-reconstructor=The matter reconstructor is capable of rearranging matter at an atomic level through processes that defies every law of nature known to your database. It could, in theory, manufacture anything composed of atomic matter. Attempts to reconfigure the machine for anything other than basic fabrication tasks are met with an unnatural sensation of dread.\n\nSomehow, you feel like it's judging you.
assembling-machine=The assembling machine is a jack of all trades, capable of a diverse variety of tasks, but not the most efficient at any.
#Generators
proton-decay-thermolectric-generator=The Proton Decay Thermoelectric Generator (PD-TEG) can harvest the energy released when protons decay. Proton decay is exceedingly rare under normal conditions, but becomes inevitable with sufficienct application of accelerated time feilds. \n\nIn a way, this device can be described as power from the end of the universe.
#thermal
small-radiator=Radiators passively remove heat from any connected heat pipes and radiate it into space. The energy is lost forever.
