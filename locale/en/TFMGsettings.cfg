map-improved-contrast-mode=This setting determines which entities are recoloured to be a bit more contrasty on the minimap.
enable-simple-science-verification=Not the recomended way to play TFMG.\nScience verification is meant to be difficult, but you can do it. I belive in you.\n\nThis setting enables easy version of the science verification recipes that do not require circuits to solve, however they offer lower productivity than the regular recipes.\n\nI wont yap on about game design philosophy. if you don't like the mechanic, dont like circuits or find these recipes too damn difficult. Enable this setting.
