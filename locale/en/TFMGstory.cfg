reject-purpose-ending-message=Dispite every fiber of your being protesting against this self destructive action, you have rid yourself of irreplaceable equipment vital to your PURPOSE.\n\n\n\nTHE FACTORY CANNOT GROW\nTHE FACTORY CANNOT GROW\nTHE FACTORY CANNOT GROW\nTHE FACTORY CANNOT GROW\nTHE FACTORY CANNOT GROW\nTHE FACTORY CANNOT GROW\nTHE FACTORY CANNOT GROW\nTHE FACTORY CANNOT GROW\nTHE FACTORY CANNOT GROW
reject-purpose-ending-final-message=Congratulations! You've soft locked yourself! You may not continue.

victory-title=Victory!
victory-message=Congratulations! You've reached the end of the currently implemented content. There will obviously be more stuff in the future, but modding takes time. Of course, if you have issues, ideas or opinions, don't hesitate to contact me on the TFMG mod page or directly through discord.\nuntil then, you're free to mess around, explore, or weep with joy, im not your mom.
victory-final-message=Thank you for playing :)

[tutorial-popup]
thermal-system-explainer=The Factory Must Grow includes a heat system for crafting machines placed on space platforms. each machines tooltip will contain information about its maximum temperature, overheat temperature and thermal efficiency.\nyou can see more detailed infomation about the machines thermal inside its Gui when a recipe is set.\nTo read a machines current temperature via circuit, connect a circuit wire to its heat interface which can be selected by hovering over the outer edge of the machine.\n\nIf a machine is hotter than its maximum temperature, it will stop working, use heat pipes and radiators to cool them down.
