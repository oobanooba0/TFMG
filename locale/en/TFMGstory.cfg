victory-message=Congratulations! You've reached the end of the currently implemented content. There will obviously be more stuff in the future, but modding takes time. Of course, if you have issues, ideas or opinions, don't hesitate to contact me on the TFMG mod page or directly through discord.\nuntil then, you're free to mess around, explore, or weep with joy, im not your mom.
victory-final-message=Thank you for playing :)

[tutorial-popup]
thermal-system-explainer=__1__: The Factory Must Grow includes a heat system for crafting machines placed on space platforms. each machines tooltip will contain information about its maximum temperature, overheat temperature and thermal efficiency.\nTo read a machines current temperature, hover over its outer edge, you'll notice that it has a 'heat interface' the heat interface can tell you what temperature that machine currently is, and can be read by circuits if you so desire.\n\nIf a machine is hotter than its maximum temperature, it will stop working, use heat pipes and radiators (they look like pumps right now) to cool them down.
