[entity-description]
scout-o-tron=Small and quick, while sturdy enough to survive re-entry, the scout'o'tron is capable of exploration and small scale construction tasks. It comes with an integrated construction tool. It lacks any sort of weapon by default, but it has a small utility grid which can enhance the scout'o'trons capabilities.
constructron=Heavy and robust, 8 legs with enhanced motors allow this spider to achive exceptional cargo capacity making it ideal as a mobile construction hub.

big-ice-worm=Ice worms live below arrivals surface, digging through the ice and feeding on the microbes that live there. Seismic data suggests ice worms can be multiple kilometres in length, and the trenches left on the surface could suggest even larger worms have existed in the past.\n\nIt appears they take no notice of your presence.

small-crawler=Crawlers are the larval stage of ice worms, small and fragile, but much more hostile, they burst from the ground and rush to attack anything producing an unfamillar tremor pattern.
