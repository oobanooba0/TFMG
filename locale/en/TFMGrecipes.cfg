[recipe-description]
general-purpose-structure-reconstruction=Reconstruct general purpose structures from ferric asteroid chunks.
mechanical-components-reconstruction=Reconstruct mechanical components from ferric asteroid chunks
mineral-glass-cooling=Prevent the formation of crystals by agitating the mineral plate as it cools.
print-ai-processor=The matter reconstructor has allowed you to print AI processors, through a process being beyond your current understanding.\nYou attempt to study it, but you feel like it's judging you.
ai-processor=Fused crystals can be engraved with neural traces, allowing for uniquely efficient AI computation impossible with conventional computers.
cliff-explosives=You don't want to know.
#supercomputer
introspection-science=To verify introspection data, you must combine [virtual-signal=signal-A] with [virtual-signal=signal-B], using the provided mathematical operator (one of [virtual-signal=signal-plus] or [virtual-signal=signal-minus] or [virtual-signal=signal-multiplication] or [virtual-signal=signal-division]). Put the result as [virtual-signal=signal-X] into the supercomputer's input terminal.
introspection-science-easy=An alternative to complex data verification methods, simply brute force the problem. It's not efficient, but it works.
exploration-science=To verify exploration data, you must sort a list of 16 signals sequentially [virtual-signal=signal-0]-[virtual-signal=signal-F] (hexadecimal order). You will be provided with each of the signals, with a signal value corresponding to their place in the list: 1 meaning first, and 16 meaning last.\n\nTo reorder items in the list, you must provide [virtual-signal=signal-A][virtual-signal=signal-B] with signal values corresponding to the places in the list you wish to swap.\n\nEg, if you provide [virtual-signal=signal-A]1 [virtual-signal=signal-B]2 then positions 1 and 2 will be swapped. (Be aware this happens every tick.)
exploration-science-easy=An alternative to complex data verification methods, simply brute force the problem. It's not efficient, but it works.
exploitation-science=To verify exploitation data, you must calculate the distance between two points ([virtual-signal=signal-x-0],[virtual-signal=signal-y-0] and [virtual-signal=signal-x-1],[virtual-signal=signal-y-1]) and input the distance as signal [virtual-signal=signal-distance].\n\nRemember, circuit signals are integers, while the true distance may be a decimal value. As such, any [virtual-signal=signal-distance] ±1 from the true answer is acceptable.\n\nDon't be afraid to use the internet for guidance if you get stuck.

#refinery
hydrocarbon-slush-distillation=Heat up hydrocarbon slush and separate it into its components.
water-filtration=By mixing hydrocarbons and water at high heat before filtering it, we can isolate more water from the mixture.
organic-sludge-cultivation=By feeding hydrocarbons to organic sludge, and incubating the microbes, the sludge will grow.
ferric-solution-reduction=Heating ferric solution allows for the hydrocarbons to break down and release the dissolved iron back into its solid form.
volatile-chunk-decomposition=Careful heating under pressure allows the constituents of volatile chunks to be seperated and purified.
#chemistry plant
hydrocarbon-seperation=By centrifuging a mixture of substances, we can separate hydrocarbons into pure water and organic sludge.
hydrocarbon-concentration=By mixing our chemicals, we can concentrate hydrocarbons out of equal parts water and organic sludge.
ferric-ore-washing=By "washing" ferric ore with hydrocarbons, the iron can be dissolved into a ferric solution, leaving behind only the impurities in the ore.
microbe-culture=Organic sludge contains a high concentration of microbes. Some of these microbes have been identified as potentially useful, and happen to have a behaviour which causes them to avoid mineral crystals. This behavior can be abused to seperate the useful microbes from the waste, which is burnt off.
active-bio-polymers=Feeding the microbe cultures with hydrocarbons will allow them to sustain their cocooning behaviour for long enough to make useful quantities of polymers.
capacitor-discharged=Capacitors are fabricated by filling a polymer container with ferric solution and thin layers of crystal.
fused-crystalline-chunk=Attempting to fuse two excited crystals results in a destructive and sudden release of energy. Water can be used to absorb the energy and prevent its self destruction.
water=Hot steam can be condensed back into water. the process is imperfect, and doesn't yeild any energy. but in some situations, the water may be more valuable.
#furnace
ferric-ore-smelting=More resource efficient smelting of ferric plates, at the cost of taking more time.
ferric-plate=The simplest means of converting ferric chunks into plates, not the most efficient. but requires minimal infrastructure.
hot-mineral-plate=Smelting crystalline chunks in space results in hot mineral plates, which can cool into [item=crystalline-plate].
hot-mineral-plate-smelting=Smelting crystalline ore in space results in hot mineral plates, which can cool into [item=crystalline-plate].
mineral-glass=Smelting crystalline chunks on the surface always yields mineral glass, due to the fragile crystal structures of [crystalline-plate] being unable to form while under the influence of gravity.
mineral-glass-smelting=Smelting crystalline ore on the surface always yields mineral glass, due to the fragile crystal structures of [crystalline-plate] being unable to form while under the influence of gravity.
titanium-plate=Smelt titanium ore into titanium plates.
#charger
capacitor-charged=Capacitors can be charged via a generous application of electricity. This process isn't perfectly efficient and some energy is lost.
excited-crystalline-chunk-red=Impart a large current on a crystalline chunk to destabilise it.
#rocket

#radiators
evaporation-cooling=Utilising water's high heat of vaporisation, cooling can be done quickly in a small form factor.

#micro assembler
mineral-glass-singing=By "singing" to the cooling mineral plates in their natural resonant frequencies, the formation of crystal structures can be prevented. The simplicity of this process allows it to be used in a more compact form factor.
conductive-coil-anti-winding=The conventional method of creating conductive coils from ferric plates by the conventional process of rolling, extruding and winding is a manufacturing dead end with limited potential for miniaturisation. Instead, unwinding the ferric plates into conductive coils directly in a process known as "anti-winding" proved much more compact.
