[recipe-description]
general-purpose-structure-reconstruction=Reconstruct general purpose structures from ferric asteroid chunks.
mechanical-components-reconstruction=Reconstruct mechanical components from ferric asteroid chunks
mineral-glass-cooling=Prevent the formation of crystals by agitating the mineral plate as it cools.
#supercomputer
introspection-science=To verify introspection science, you must combine [virtual-signal=signal-A] with [virtual-signal=signal-B] using the correct mathmatical operator (One of [virtual-signal=signal-plus] or [virtual-signal=signal-minus] or [virtual-signal=signal-multiplication] or [virtual-signal=signal-division]), to produce some value of [virtual-signal=signal-X], which must be input in the supercomputers input terminal.

#refinery
hydrocarbon-slush-distillation=Heat up hydrocarbon slush and seperate it into its components.
water-filtration=By mixing hydrocarbons and water at high heat before filtering it we can isolate more water from the mixture.
organic-sludge-cultivation=By feeding hydrocarbons to organic sludge, and incubating the microbes, the sludge will grow.
#chemistry plant
hydrocarbon-seperation=By centrifuging a mixture of substances, we can seperate hydrocarbons into equal parts pure water and organic sludge
hydrocarbon-concentration=By mixing our chemicals we can concentrate hydrocrabons out of equal parts water and organic sludge.

small-radiator-radiation=Heat energy is radiated into space and is lost forever.
