[recipe-description]

mechanical-components-reconstruction=Reconstruct mechanical components from ferric asteroid chunks
mineral-glass-cooling=Prevent the formation of crystals by agitating the mineral plate as it cools.
#supercomputer
introspection-science=To verify introspection data, you must combine [virtual-signal=signal-A] with [virtual-signal=signal-B] using the provided mathmatical operator (One of [virtual-signal=signal-plus] or [virtual-signal=signal-minus] or [virtual-signal=signal-multiplication] or [virtual-signal=signal-division]), to produce some value of [virtual-signal=signal-X], which must be input in the supercomputers input terminal.
exploration-science=To verify exploration data you must calculate the distance between two points ([virtual-signal=signal-x-0],[virtual-signal=signal-y-0] and[virtual-signal=signal-x-1],[virtual-signal=signal-y-1]) and input the distance as signal [virtual-signal=signal-distance].\n\nRemember, circuit signals are integers, while the true distance may be a decimal value, as such, any [virtual-signal=signal-distance] Â±1 from the true answer is acceptable.\n\nDon't be afraid to use the internet for guidance if you get stuck.
#refinery
hydrocarbon-slush-distillation=Heat up hydrocarbon slush and seperate it into its components.
water-filtration=By mixing hydrocarbons and water at high heat before filtering it we can isolate more water from the mixture.
organic-sludge-cultivation=By feeding hydrocarbons to organic sludge, and incubating the microbes, the sludge will grow.
#chemistry plant
hydrocarbon-seperation=By centrifuging a mixture of substances, we can seperate hydrocarbons into pure water and organic sludge.
hydrocarbon-concentration=By mixing our chemicals we can concentrate hydrocrabons out of equal parts water and organic sludge.

small-radiator-radiation=Heat energy is radiated into space and is lost forever.
