[recipe-description]
general-purpose-structure-reconstruction=Reconstruct general purpose structures from ferric asteroid chunks.
mechanical-components-reconstruction=Reconstruct mechanical components from ferric asteroid chunks
mineral-glass-cooling=Prevent the formation of crystals by agitating the mineral plate as it cools.
print-ai-processor=The matter reconstructor has allowed you to print ai processors, through a process being beyond your current understanding. \nYou attempt to study it, but you feel like its judging you.
ai-processor=Fused crystals can be engraved with neural traces, allowing for uniquely efficient AI computation impossible with conventional computers.
#supercomputer
introspection-science=To verify introspection data, you must combine [virtual-signal=signal-A] with [virtual-signal=signal-B] using the provided mathmatical operator (One of [virtual-signal=signal-plus] or [virtual-signal=signal-minus] or [virtual-signal=signal-multiplication] or [virtual-signal=signal-division]), to produce some value of [virtual-signal=signal-X], which must be input in the supercomputers input terminal.
exploration-science=To verify exploration data you must calculate the distance between two points ([virtual-signal=signal-x-0],[virtual-signal=signal-y-0] and[virtual-signal=signal-x-1],[virtual-signal=signal-y-1]) and input the distance as signal [virtual-signal=signal-distance].\n\nRemember, circuit signals are integers, while the true distance may be a decimal value, as such, any [virtual-signal=signal-distance] Â±1 from the true answer is acceptable.\n\nDon't be afraid to use the internet for guidance if you get stuck.
#refinery
hydrocarbon-slush-distillation=Heat up hydrocarbon slush and seperate it into its components.
water-filtration=By mixing hydrocarbons and water at high heat before filtering it we can isolate more water from the mixture.
organic-sludge-cultivation=By feeding hydrocarbons to organic sludge, and incubating the microbes, the sludge= will grow.
ferric-solution-reduction=Heating ferric solution allows for the hydrocarbons to break down and release the dissolved iron back into its solid form.
#chemistry plant
hydrocarbon-seperation=By centrifuging a mixture of substances, we can seperate hydrocarbons into pure water and organic sludge.
hydrocarbon-concentration=By mixing our chemicals we can concentrate hydrocrabons out of equal parts water and organic sludge.
ferric-ore-washing=By "washing" ferric ore with hydrocarbons, the iron can be disolved into a ferric solution, leaving behind only the impurities in the ore.
microbe-extraction=Organic sludge contains a high concentration of microbes, some of these microbes have been identified as potentiall useful, and happen to have a behaviour which causes them to avoid mineral crystals, this behavior can be abused to seperate the useful microbes from the waste, which is burnt off.
bio-polymerisation=Feeding the microbe cultures with hydrocarbons will allow them to sustain their coocooning behaviour for long enough to make useful quantites of polymers.
capacitor-discharged=Capacitors are fabricated by filling a polymer container with ferric solution and thin layers of crystal.
excited-crystal-quenching=attempting to fuse two excited crystals results in a destructive and sudden release of energy. Water can be used to absorb the energy and prevent its self destruction.
#furnace
ferric-ore-smelting=more resource efficient smelting of ferric plates, at the cost of taking more time.
ferric-plate=The simplest means of converting ferric chunks into plates, not the most efficient. but requires minimal infrastructure.
hot-mineral-plate=Smelting crystalline chunks in space results in hot mineral plates, which can cool into crystalline plates
hot-mineral-plate-smelting=Smelting crystalline ore in space results in hot mineral plates, which can cool into crystalline plates.
mineral-glass=Smelting crystalline chunks on the surface always yeilds mineral glass, due to the fragile crystal structures being unable to form while under the influence of gravity.
mineral-glass-smelting=Smelting crystalline ore on the surface always yeilds mineral glass, due to the fragile crystal structures being unable to form while under the influence of gravity.
titanium-ore-smelting=Smelt titanium ore into titanium plates.
#charger
capacitor-charged=Capacitors can be charged via a generous application of electricity, this process isn't perfectly efficient and some energy is lost.
excited-crystalline-chunk-red=Impart a large current on crystalline chunk to destablise it.

small-radiator-radiation=Heat energy is radiated into space and is lost forever.
