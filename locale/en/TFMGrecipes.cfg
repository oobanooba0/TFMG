#supercomputer
introspection-science=To verify introspection science, you must combine [virtual-signal=signal-A] with [virtual-signal=signal-B] using the correct mathmatical operator ([virtual-signal=signal-plus][virtual-signal=signal-minus][virtual-signal=signal-multiplication][virtual-signal=signal-division]), to produce some value of [virtual-signal=signal-X], which must be input in the supercomputers input terminal.


small-radiator-radiation=Heat energy is radiated into space and is lost forever.
