    - Massive internal code improvements.
    - they move below.
  Features:
    - Orbital vehichle deployment mod added to replace the old drop spidertron button.
    - You now start the game on course to arrival. This means you get significantly more asteroids in the early phase of the game, but their avalability will drop sharply once you reach arrival.
    - (near) Void space location added, you cant go there a the moment, it's just for the intro.
    - Limit space location added, as a gas giant, you cant land there, but Limit will act as a connection point for future planets.
    - Radiators now have a hot new custom graphic.
    - Heat management 2 added, now a prerequisite of exploration science.
    - Evaporation radiator added, a ground placed radiator for heat removal on planets. where normal radiators can't be placed. Unlocked by heat management 2

    - optional compatibility with visible planets mod added. I think its pretty.
    - some achivements added
    - Light and heavy space platform added: light space platform is expensive, but light (and good for space ships) heavy space platform is cheap but heavy (good for stationary platforms)

    - 1 music track added to space.
    - titanium pipes added, which allow for pipe weaving.
    - Walls and gates added.

  Changes:
    - old saves broken. Just not realistic to fix that.
    - old menu simulations are removed :( I added some new ones from my personal save to replace them.
    - Most irrelevant vanilla content is hidden from the game, GUI clutter is no more.
    - Small radiators are now 1x5. They now only radiate 2MW of heat, down from 5MW. (still means a 1.5x increase in radiation:surface area so technically a buff.)
    - Small radiators internals ported to TFMG thermal mod.
    - All machines are ported over to the new TFMG Thermal thermal system, which is a significantly improved version of the old thermal system, Its infinitely easier for me to dev with as well as being massively more performant at scale. (It took me over a week to do this, but its genuinely huge)
    - Computer type buildings (super computer, and neural nodes) always have the thermal system, regardless of surface. Theres now no reason to do science on the surface.
    - Supercomputers now have the inputs on the south side when in north rotation. This will mess up your blueprints.
    - Supercomputers are now 11x11
    - Supercomputer terminals are now visible in blueprints before placing, and always above the supercomputer base. (so that theyre always visible)
    - Heat monitor now unlocked by heat management 2

    - Starting intro message has been changed.
    - old tutorial popup removed, we don't need it.
    - small chests now have 5 slots, with 1 stack per slot.
    - Contemplate MIND is renamed to Evaluate MIND.

    - Small electric pylons dont need tiny pylons anymore.
    - heat related entities are now red on maps for clarity.
    - Energy monitor now has 10j of storage, so it will discharge and charge 10x faster

    - Scout'o'tron pods technology and item removed. You can now drop scout'o'trons with equipment using the orbital vehicle deployment button.
    - spidertron frames now use mechanical components too.
  Balancing:
    - Small radiators stack to 50
    - Small radiators now cost half to craft
    - Heat pipes now have 250kJ specific heat, which means theyll heat up and cool down much faster, and have a lower overall energy transfer capacity.
    - Machines no longer have damage resistances (For now, while theres no meaningful sorces of damage in the game)
    - Supercomputer now has a lower damage temperature, and slightly higher max temperature. (making it slightly riskier to use)
    - Supercomputers now use 100MW, which in practice, is 100MW, because they now consume power while attempting to craft. Be smart about supercomputers.
    - Arrival orbit has fewer chunks. (this is compensated by the fact that you will be moving at a high speed during the platform phase.)
    - first pre science inserter capacity bonus has been removed- You just dont need it.
    - long handed inserters are now half as fast as their regular inserter counterpart.
    - Small electric pylon now reaches 13 tiles.
    - Titanium plates now arent used in any end product, being exclusively an intermediate. This should make malls easier.
    - Chemical reactors no longer require titanium, using only general purpose structures.
    - Chemical reactor technology now has contemplate life as a prerequisite instaid of contemplate rust
    - Rails use high performance structures instaid of titanium.
    - Ferric solution reduction is now slower
    - Introspection data card can only be crafted in space.
    - Exploration science can only be crafted on arrival
    - AI processor printing recipe now costs 2 crystalline plates, to make building the first rockets easier, but requires 6 modular circuits and 12 conductive coils.
    - Rocket part cost rebalanced.
    - Ice geysers contains less fluid now. (roughly 1/3rd of old quantities) Old value was extremely high.
    - Ice geysers has lower yield when pumped. (10 from 100)
    - Ice geysers are pumped faster. (0.5s from 1s)
    - Hydrocarbon slush distilation now has much lower yield.
    - Short chain hydrocarbon energy value is now only 1.5kj
    - Proton decay thermoelectric generator now produces only 250MW of energy. Enough for bootstrapping, but it wont carry your base like it used to.

  Features:
    - Rocket silo added.
    - Rocket part recipe added.
    - Default import location changed
    - barrels and fluid barreling added. Autobarrel2 is a custom script based on the vanilla one, but it allows for barrels with different masses, densities, crafting times, etc.
    - Added a very lazy thruster fuel and thruster fuel recipe. Expect these to change with the next major update.
    - thruster fuel and thruster oxidizer arent meant to go through pipes (theyre LOx and LH2), but they can, because of modding api limitations, This is upsetting me greatly.
    - cliff explosives added
    - items now have rather arbitrarily chosen weights. These will change.
  Changes:
    - Hid a number of vanilla intermediates from factoriopedia
    - Removed a number of vanilla recipes to reduce factoriopedia clutter. Still working on this, some recipes just don't want to cooperate and I don't feel like sorting it out right now.
    - Refined concrete is now replaced with regular concrete.
    - hazard concrete added.
    - items that have multiple alternate recipes, i.e. ferric plates dont show up multiple times in factoriopedia anymore.

    - Chat easter egg.
  Changes:
    - Crystal quenching recipe takes 4 seconds now.
    - Organic carbon liquefaction now returns short chain hydrocarbons instead of organic sludge. Sorry if this broke anything.

    - Matter reconstructor has a whopping 12 module slots. Go ham.
    - Assembling machine has 6 module slots.
    - furnace has 4 module slots
    - Supercomputer has 5 module slots, however, due to its nature, only accepts efficiency and quality modules. I may change this in the future.

    - AI processors are now a standard intermediate.
    - Victory tech has been moved back to after contemplate mind.
  Balancing:
    - organic carbon is now a much weaker fuel, has 0.5 acceleration and 0.8 top speed multiplier. It will get your trains moving. (though it benefits from a higher energy density than capacitors, so trains using it will go futher)
    - Locomotives have 2 fuel slots and 2 fuel waste slots, range limitations can be a real concern in the early game.
    - Locomotives are heavier. Cargo wagons remain the same, Longer trains should make more sense.
    - Ferric solution is now produced in half the quantity, and consumed in half the quantity.
  Bugfixes:
    - Supercomputer now properly resets recipe when unsetting recipe. This should reduce confusion when players accidentally tamper with the supercomputer output terminal.

Date: 2025-09-28
  Changes:
    - Ferric ore washing yeilds slightly less ferric solution, and costs slightly less ferric ore. This should mean a factory producing only exploration science doesn't jam up if don't make titanium with every signgle peice of ferric ore you produce. This also makes titanium slightly cheaper.
    - Technologies have more descriptive descriptions. Still need quotes for many (PLS suggest me quotes!)
  Bugfixes:
    - repeatable techs now share the same description locale.
    - fix migration of belt recipes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-09-17
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a number of spelling errors, thanks Asterixyz
    - Belts tooltip read 15 per second to reflect actual belt speed. (16 items per second isnt possible)
    - RIP 2^4 belt speeds, I was informed by PFQNiet that factorio belt speeds can only increment in 1.875 values, so 16/s just ends up being 15/s but with janky animations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.4
Date: 2025-09-17
  Changes:
    - Matter reconstructor now takes ALL recipes that the assembling machine can, EXCEPT the ones that it has a special replacement for (General purpose structures, Conductive coils, Mechanical components, Modular circuits), this should give players more freedom to abuse the overpowered nature of the matter reconstructor, because its fun.

Version: 0.1.8
Date: 2025-09-07
  Features:
    - First planet added: Arrival. you can now explore the surface. nothing to do here yet, just enjoy the scenery.
    - You can now deploy Scout'o'trons onto the surface of arrival via the space platform UI
    - Arrival now has some world gen, nothing too fancy, nor final, but it should get at the intended vibe of the planet.
    - Ice worms added. "That's only a juvenile!"

Version: 0.1.7
Date: 2025-09-02
  Features:
    - Divergent production chain added for crystalline asteroids. They now smelt into Hot mineral plates, which naturally cool (spoil) into Crystalline plates. But if disturbed, they will turn into mineral glass instaid.
    - Crystalline asteroids smelt directly into mineral glass when smelted on the surface, crystaline plates can only be produced in space.
    - Mineral Glass added
    - Hot Mineral plates added
  Changes:
    - Crystalline asteroids now produce Hot mineral plates when smelted instaid of crystalline plates directly
    - Conductive coil now uses ferric plates, Idk why they used Crystalline plates before, as they were explicitly non-conductive.
    - Recipies which use Crystalline plates now use mineral glass (this will make them aquirable on the surface later.) Excluded from these changes is the AI processor, which is intended to be crafted in space at this stage of the game.
