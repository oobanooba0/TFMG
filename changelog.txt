Version: 0.1.13
Date: ????
  Features:
    - Data verification system added. Science packs now must be verified in a supercomputer before they can be processed.
    - Supercomputer added
  Changes:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.12
Date: 2025-09-10
  Bugfixes:
    - heat pipes now snap to buildings properly. oops. Thanks Louloubichou for catching that one
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.11
Date: 2025-09-10
  Features:
    - Main Menu theme "PURPOSE" added, created by yours truly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.10
Date: 2025-09-08
  Features:
    - Machines beyond 100c over their max temperature will now take damage! Be careful when designing your systems!
    - Many thermal system improvments! (proper interface still in progress)
    - A true ending?
  Changes:
    - Furnace now has a max operating temperature of 400c instaid of 750c, To make it more similar to the assembling machine, but still noticably higher.
    - Thermal system objects now place at near max operating temperature, to make abusing manual replacement less appealing. They should still be able to craft for a little bit though, so you wont have to deal with aquilo waiting for a build to heat up syndrome.
    - all thermal system objects now accept heat over their overheat temperature. 
    - arrival is no longer generated until you actually deploy your Scout'o'tron, this prevents players from accidentally dropping important items onto the surface and softlocking themselves.
    - matter reconstructor is indistructable, I suggest you use this power wisely
    - Proton decay thermolectric generator is now also indestructable.
  Bugfixes:
    - Thermal system now doesn't apply on planet surfaces!
    - Fixed crash when destroying thermal interface parents via editor or other instantanious means.
    - heat interfaces now have no hitbox - this solves a number of issues
    - pasting assembling machines onto existing assembling machines now no longer blocked by heat interface.
    - heat interfaces are indestructable, except by the destruction of their parent object
    - heat interfaces can no longer tank incoming asteroid damage, preventing asteroids from damaging the platform below.

Version: 0.1.9
Date: 2025-09-07
  Bugfixes:
    - fixed some items not visible in selection menus at game start
    - fixed machine heat interfaces not being selectable (tempoary while I add a proper gui)
  Changes:
    - you now start with 500 space platforms to save your poor fingers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.8
Date: 2025-09-07
  Features:
    - First planet added: Arrival. you can now explore the surface. nothing to do here yet, just enjoy the scenery.
    - You can now deploy Scout'o'trons onto the surface of arrival via the space platform UI
    - Arrival now has some world gen, nothing too fancy, nor final, but it should get at the intended vibe of the planet.
    - Ice worms added. "That's only a juvenile!"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.7
Date: 2025-09-02
  Features:
    - Divergent production chain added for crystalline asteroids. They now smelt into Hot mineral plates, which naturally cool (spoil) into Crystalline plates. But if disturbed, they will turn into mineral glass instaid.
    - Crystalline asteroids smelt directly into mineral glass when smelted on the surface, crystaline plates can only be produced in space.
    - Mineral Glass added
    - Hot Mineral plates added
  Changes:
    - Crystalline asteroids now produce Hot mineral plates when smelted instaid of crystalline plates directly
    - Conductive coil now uses ferric plates, Idk why they used Crystalline plates before, as they were explicitly non-conductive.
    - Recipies which use Crystalline plates now use mineral glass (this will make them aquirable on the surface later.) Excluded from these changes is the AI processor, which is intended to be crafted in space at this stage of the game.

Version: 0.1.6
Date: 2025-09-01
  Bugfixes:
    - Asteroid Chunks (and some other items) now appear in selection menus
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.5
Date: 2025-09-01
  Features:
    - Machines now have a status indicator when overheated
    - Machines now have max temperature and thermal efficiency in their tooltip.
    - Machine Heat interfaces now have a temperature bar and can be connected to circuits.
    - Machines now have much prettier heat pipe connections
  Balancing:
    - Scout'o'tron is a bit faster.
