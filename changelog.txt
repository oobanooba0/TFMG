Version: 0.3.12
Date: ????
  Features:
    - Speed and efficiency modules introduced, they have stats comparable to the MKI modules from vanilla, but most buildings have more module slots than their vanilla counterparts, so these modules are pretty powerful.
    - Micro assembler added
    - Mineral glass singing alt recipe added
    - Conductive coil anti-winding alt recipe added
  Changes:
    - Supercomputer input and output are now blue and green respectively.
    - Supercomputer is visually shrunken down slightly to make input/output terminals more visible in all rotations.
    - most machines have module slots now, numbers are kind of arbitrary and will change.
    - Matter reconstructor has a whopping 12 module slots. Go ham.
    - Assembling machine has 6 module slots.
    - furnace has 4 module slots
    - Supercomputer has 5 module slots, however, due to its nature, only accepts productivity and efficiency modules. I may change this in the future.
    - chemistry plant has 4 module slots.
    - refinery has 6 module slots.
    - micro assembler has 3 module slots.
    - small crusher has 3 module slots.
    - mining drill has 4 module slots.
    - pumpjack has 4 module slots.
    - Neural node has 5 module slots.
    - efficiency module is slightly stronger than its vanilla counterpart.
    - Speed modules incur a slightly higher energy cost than its vanilla counterpart.
    - discharger recipe changed to require tier 2 components
    - AI processor costs slightly more optical coil.
  Balancing:
    - productivity modules are allowed on most intermediates where it makes sense. (No prod modules in the game yet, just prepping)
    - Ai processor printing recipe now takes twice as long.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.11
Date: 2025-10-04
  Features:
    - All intermediates now have a description.
    - Many more recipes have a description.
    - Capacitors (item) added. Capacitors can be used as superior fuel for trains, In equipment grids, as an intermediate, or as a form of energy storage.
    - Capacitor charging added. Capacitors store energy at 60% efficiency. (No accumulators for you, sorry. Use chargers and dischargers.)
    - Charger added. Chargers can charge chargable items like capacitors. Useful for power storage. Will have many more functions in the future.
    - Discharger added, however, Expect its unlock and recipe to change in the future.
    - Excited crystals added
    - Fused crystals added
    - AI processor recipe added.
  Changes:
    - Changed super computer status indicator to better reflect its condition.
    - Thermal system explainer updated for current version.
    - container 1 is renamed to container I
    - Logistics containers now have I appended to their name to indicate their tier.
    - Conditions for mineral plate/hot mineral plate recipes have been changed to gravity instaid of pressure to be more in line with item and recipe descriptions.
    - AI processors are now a standard intermediate.
    - Victory tech has been moved back to after contemplate mind.
  Balancing:
    - organic carbon is now a much weaker fuel, has 0.5 acceleration and 0.8 top speed multiplier. It will get your trains moving. (though it benefits from a higher energy density than capacitors, so trains using it will go futher)
    - Locomotives have 2 fuel slots and 2 fuel waste slots, range limitations can be a real concern in the early game.
    - Locomotives are heavier. Cargo wagons remain the same, Longer trains should make more sense.
    - Ferric solution is now produced in half the quantity, and consumed in half the quantity.
  Bugfixes:
    - Supercomputer now properly resets recipe when unsetting recipe. This should reduce confusion when players accidentally tamper with the supercomputer output terminal.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.10
Date: 2025-10-02
  Bugfixes:
    - Thermal Gui now no longer causes crashes in multiplayer
    - thermal Gui now properly clears itself out when the machine associated with an active gui is destroyed while the gui is open.
    - I hate gui modding.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.9
Date: 2025-10-02
  Changes:
    - thermal efficiency is now waste heat output percentage. Which makes heat output easier to figure out.
    - janky radiator graphics are now slightly less janky
  Bugfixes:
    - Proton decay thermolectric generator is now called that
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.8

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.6
Date: 2025-10-01
  Changes:
    - Ice worms now spawn less significantly less frequently.
  Balancing:
    - Arrival now has guaranteed starting patches
    - Crystalline/mineral ore now spawns less frequently, You'll really need a rail system on this planet.
    - Ore patches now scale with distance faster.
    - Mineral ore patches are slightly smaller, and slightly more frequent.
    - Crystaline ore now has a 400% mining time. Those patches are large for a reason.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-09-29
  Changes:
    - Assets have been moved to submod (this should make updating easier)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.4
Date: 2025-09-28
  Changes:
    - Ferric ore washing yeilds slightly less ferric solution, and costs slightly less ferric ore. This should mean a factory producing only exploration science doesn't jam up if don't make titanium with every signgle peice of ferric ore you produce. This also makes titanium slightly cheaper.
    - Technologies have more descriptive descriptions. Still need quotes for many (PLS suggest me quotes!)
  Bugfixes:
    - repeatable techs now share the same description locale.
    - fix migration of belt recipes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.3
Date: 2025-09-28

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.2
Date: 2025-09-28
  Changes:
    - Transport belt 1 and transport belt 2 have been removed in favour of modifying their vanilla counterparts. This change should be seamless, as existing belts are magically transformed to their vanilla counterparts. This should mean your balancer blueprints work happily now!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.1
Date: 2025-09-27
  Features:
    - organic carbon liquefaction allows for disposal of organic carbon.

  Changes:
    - Asteroid chunks now stack to 20
    - Asteroid chunks are now collected in batches of 10
    - Asteroid chunks now smelt to 1 plate
    - Ore patches now result in chunks. This set of changes helps me reduce the number of redundant intermediates, which in turn should save the player time on boring crafting steps.
    - Roboport connection range extended
    - Heat pipes now require mineral glass (Mineral glass is actually more useful now!)
    - Arrival pressure increased, due it affecting robots. (Wube, why couldn't this have just been a seperate hidden property?)
    - Small Radiator are now placed off the space platform, and can no longer be abused.
    - Underground Belt 1 reaches 6 tiles instaid of 5.
    - space platform foundation is even cheaper. I hate crafting it so much.

Date: 2025-09-17
  Changes:
    - Ice ore removed - it was merely a test to see if i could.
    - Ferric ore added
    - Mineral ore added
    - Ice geysers added + Hydrocarbon Slush
  Bugfixes:
    - multiplayer works now, thanks to the help of my friend, noobaooba. who is just me.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.5
Date: 2025-09-17
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a number of spelling errors, thanks Asterixyz
    - Belts tooltip read 15 per second to reflect actual belt speed. (16 items per second isnt possible)
    - RIP 2^4 belt speeds, I was informed by PFQNiet that factorio belt speeds can only increment in 1.875 values, so 16/s just ends up being 15/s but with janky animations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.4
Date: 2025-09-17
  Changes:
    - Matter reconstructor now takes ALL recipes that the assembling machine can, EXCEPT the ones that it has a special replacement for (General purpose structures, Conductive coils, Mechanical components, Modular circuits), this should give players more freedom to abuse the overpowered nature of the matter reconstructor, because its fun.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - solar-cells are now an equipment grid item for construction bots
    - solar cell equipment works at night with 20% efficiency due to the long day night cycle of Arrival, this should stop you from being unable to construct anything.
    - arrival has an 85 minute day night cycle.
    - Scout'o'tron deployment script is now improved
    - basic roboports have been added, they are both buildings and equipment grid items for spiders. I don't feel like wasting your time crafting a "personal roboport" Equipment grid items and buildings will be equivilent unless i see fit otherwise.
    - platform-1 menu sim updated to reflect these changes
    - oh yeah, its all coming together
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.12
Date: 2025-09-10
  Bugfixes:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.11
Date: 2025-09-10
  Features:
    - Main Menu theme "PURPOSE" added, created by yours truly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.10
Date: 2025-09-08
  Features:
    - Machines beyond 100c over their max temperature will now take damage! Be careful when designing your systems!
    - Many thermal system improvments! (proper interface still in progress)
    - A true ending?
  Changes:
    - Furnace now has a max operating temperature of 400c instaid of 750c, To make it more similar to the assembling machine, but still noticably higher.
    - Thermal system objects now place at near max operating temperature, to make abusing manual replacement less appealing. They should still be able to craft for a little bit though, so you wont have to deal with aquilo waiting for a build to heat up syndrome.
    - all thermal system objects now accept heat over their overheat temperature. 
    - arrival is no longer generated until you actually deploy your Scout'o'tron, this prevents players from accidentally dropping important items onto the surface and softlocking themselves.
    - matter reconstructor is indistructable, I suggest you use this power wisely
    - Proton decay thermolectric generator is now also indestructable.
  Bugfixes:
    - Thermal system now doesn't apply on planet surfaces!
    - Fixed crash when destroying thermal interface parents via editor or other instantanious means.
    - heat interfaces now have no hitbox - this solves a number of issues
    - pasting assembling machines onto existing assembling machines now no longer blocked by heat interface.
    - heat interfaces are indestructable, except by the destruction of their parent object
    - heat interfaces can no longer tank incoming asteroid damage, preventing asteroids from damaging the platform below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.9
Date: 2025-09-07

  Changes:
    - you now start with 500 space platforms to save your poor fingers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.8
Date: 2025-09-07
  Features:
    - First planet added: Arrival. you can now explore the surface. nothing to do here yet, just enjoy the scenery.
    - You can now deploy Scout'o'trons onto the surface of arrival via the space platform UI
    - Arrival now has some world gen, nothing too fancy, nor final, but it should get at the intended vibe of the planet.
    - Ice worms added. "That's only a juvenile!"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.7
Date: 2025-09-02
  Features:
    - Divergent production chain added for crystalline asteroids. They now smelt into Hot mineral plates, which naturally cool (spoil) into Crystalline plates. But if disturbed, they will turn into mineral glass instaid.
    - Crystalline asteroids smelt directly into mineral glass when smelted on the surface, crystaline plates can only be produced in space.
    - Mineral Glass added
    - Hot Mineral plates added
  Changes:
    - Crystalline asteroids now produce Hot mineral plates when smelted instaid of crystalline plates directly
    - Conductive coil now uses ferric plates, Idk why they used Crystalline plates before, as they were explicitly non-conductive.
    - Recipies which use Crystalline plates now use mineral glass (this will make them aquirable on the surface later.) Excluded from these changes is the AI processor, which is intended to be crafted in space at this stage of the game.
