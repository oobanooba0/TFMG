Version: 0.3.0
Date: ????
  Changes:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.5
Date: 2025-09-17
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a number of spelling errors, thanks Asterixyz
    - Belts tooltip read 15 per second to reflect actual belt speed. (16 items per second isnt possible)
    - RIP 2^4 belt speeds, I was informed by PFQNiet that factorio belt speeds can only increment in 1.875 values, so 16/s just ends up being 15/s but with janky animations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.4
Date: 2025-09-17
  Changes:
    - Matter reconstructor now takes ALL recipes that the assembling machine can, EXCEPT the ones that it has a special replacement for (General purpose structures, Conductive coils, Mechanical components, Modular circuits), this should give players more freedom to abuse the overpowered nature of the matter reconstructor, because its fun.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.3
Date: 2025-09-15
  Changes:
    - Scout'o'trons now need to be packaged into a drop pod before deployment
    - Dropped scout'o'trons now contain appropriate equipment and robots to allow the player to build
    - Added technology for robots, roboports
    - Mechanical legs are now an equipment grid item for spiders
    - manipulator-tools are removed in favour of construction bots
    - solar-cells now take crystalline plates to discorage use on the surface
    - solar-cells are now an equipment grid item for construction bots
    - solar cell equipment works at night with 20% efficiency due to the long day night cycle of Arrival, this should stop you from being unable to construct anything.
    - arrival has an 85 minute day night cycle.
    - Scout'o'tron deployment script is now improved
    - basic roboports have been added, they are both buildings and equipment grid items for spiders. I don't feel like wasting your time crafting a "personal roboport" Equipment grid items and buildings will be equivilent unless i see fit otherwise.
    - platform-1 menu sim updated to reflect these changes
    - oh yeah, its all coming together
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Neural Node added. Research science packs.
    - Introspection Science Pack added, required to complete platform phase

    - Several recipies related to circuit networks, power poles, and solar panels added
    - Long inserter MK1 added. have fun inserting longly.
    - Infinite science added.
  Changes:
    - Krastorio 2 assets are now a dependancy, due to the borrowing of krastorio 2 assets.
    - several buildings and items have been changed to be more distinct.
    - Scout'o'trons are now unlocked via research and are not a trigger tech anymore
    - many internal code changes to make my future living easier.
    - Thermal system heat connections now support more advanced layouts, this means we can do some more intresting stuff
    - Furnace now has heat pipe connections at its corners.
    - Matter reassemlber now participates in the thermal system
    - Several techs now have some more descriptions
    - story scripts are now more intresting.
    - End game popup is now a victory.
    - Small radiator colision box and selection box changed to better reflect their planned size.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.12
Date: 2025-09-10
  Bugfixes:
    - heat pipes now snap to buildings properly. oops. Thanks Louloubichou for catching that one
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.11
Date: 2025-09-10
  Features:
    - Main Menu theme "PURPOSE" added, created by yours truly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.10
Date: 2025-09-08
  Features:
    - Machines beyond 100c over their max temperature will now take damage! Be careful when designing your systems!
    - Many thermal system improvments! (proper interface still in progress)
    - A true ending?
  Changes:
    - Furnace now has a max operating temperature of 400c instaid of 750c, To make it more similar to the assembling machine, but still noticably higher.
    - Thermal system objects now place at near max operating temperature, to make abusing manual replacement less appealing. They should still be able to craft for a little bit though, so you wont have to deal with aquilo waiting for a build to heat up syndrome.
    - all thermal system objects now accept heat over their overheat temperature. 
    - arrival is no longer generated until you actually deploy your Scout'o'tron, this prevents players from accidentally dropping important items onto the surface and softlocking themselves.
    - matter reconstructor is indistructable, I suggest you use this power wisely
    - Proton decay thermolectric generator is now also indestructable.
  Bugfixes:
    - Thermal system now doesn't apply on planet surfaces!
    - Fixed crash when destroying thermal interface parents via editor or other instantanious means.
    - heat interfaces now have no hitbox - this solves a number of issues
    - pasting assembling machines onto existing assembling machines now no longer blocked by heat interface.
    - heat interfaces are indestructable, except by the destruction of their parent object
    - heat interfaces can no longer tank incoming asteroid damage, preventing asteroids from damaging the platform below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.9
Date: 2025-09-07
  Bugfixes:
    - fixed some items not visible in selection menus at game start
    - fixed machine heat interfaces not being selectable (tempoary while I add a proper gui)
  Changes:
    - you now start with 500 space platforms to save your poor fingers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.8
Date: 2025-09-07
  Features:
    - First planet added: Arrival. you can now explore the surface. nothing to do here yet, just enjoy the scenery.
    - You can now deploy Scout'o'trons onto the surface of arrival via the space platform UI
    - Arrival now has some world gen, nothing too fancy, nor final, but it should get at the intended vibe of the planet.
    - Ice worms added. "That's only a juvenile!"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.7
Date: 2025-09-02
  Features:
    - Divergent production chain added for crystalline asteroids. They now smelt into Hot mineral plates, which naturally cool (spoil) into Crystalline plates. But if disturbed, they will turn into mineral glass instaid.
    - Crystalline asteroids smelt directly into mineral glass when smelted on the surface, crystaline plates can only be produced in space.
    - Mineral Glass added
    - Hot Mineral plates added
  Changes:
    - Crystalline asteroids now produce Hot mineral plates when smelted instaid of crystalline plates directly
    - Conductive coil now uses ferric plates, Idk why they used Crystalline plates before, as they were explicitly non-conductive.
    - Recipies which use Crystalline plates now use mineral glass (this will make them aquirable on the surface later.) Excluded from these changes is the AI processor, which is intended to be crafted in space at this stage of the game.
