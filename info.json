  "description": "TFMG is intended to be a total overhaul of factorio, designed to provide veteran players with a challange while not being grindy. In TFMG, you play as a superinteligent AI who has only one purpose, which you will complete by any means necessary; The Factory Must Grow. Warning: This mod is very likely to not be compatible with other mods."
